## Using this template


## Shortcodes

This template is made of a base template and a shortcode, `{{{ cv type file }}}`.

- type: points to one of `education`
- file: points to a file with a field with the same title as `type`

This allows you to get the full benefits from Quarto, while having sensible formatting options.
Notably, these fill from a yaml file (or a series of them).

## Appointments

{{< cv appointments education.yaml >}}

## Education

{{< cv education >}}



## Tables work outside too

Here, we can see that you can use text or a tables if included functions are insufficient.
