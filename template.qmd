## Using this template


The goal of this template is to combine Quarto's best features with typst's best to get a cv powered by shortcodes.
For the best exerience, you will want to combine shortcodes with text in Quarto.
The shortcodes will format standard entries, but do not cover all possible cases.
As such, you may want to format some things using `typst` blocks or any other Quarto inputs.
This template was designed by [Christopher T. Kenny](https://christophertkenny.com/). Full directions listed at the end of this document.


## Appointments

{{< cv appointments education.yaml >}}

## Education

{{< cv education >}}

## Books

:::{#refs-books}
:::

## Peer-Reviewed Articles

:::{#refs-articles}
:::

## Book Chapters

:::{#refs-bookchapters}
:::

## Honors

{{< cv honors >}}

## Service

{{< cv positions >}}

## Shortcodes

This template is made of a base template and a shortcode, `{{{< cv type file >}}}`.

- type: points to one of the supported shortcode types below
- file: points to a file with a field with the same title as `type`

This allows you to get the full benefits from Quarto, while having sensible formatting options.
Notably, these fill from a yaml file (or a series of them).

The supported shortcodes types are:

- appointments: for academic appointment information (example file: `education.yaml` under `appointments`)
- education: for education history (example file: `education.yaml` under `education`)
- positions: for other positions or services (example file: `positions.yaml`)
- honors: for listing honors (example file: `honors.yaml`)

Note that all of these will fill in based on the order in the YAML. I recommend listing them in reverse order and potentially moving any lifetime awards to the top.

## Listing references

This template ships with an adjusted version of `chicago-author-date.csl`, as `nosort-chicago-author-date.csl`. The two differences here are that it doesn't sort, so whatever order is in your `.bib` file is the order that the references will be displayed. Second, it does not replace authors with `---` when you coauthor with the same group repeatedly. As there is no sorting, this looks funny if you have a random case of this, compared to a normal bibliography.
If your `.bib` is messy, use `revsort-chicago-author-date.csl` instead, which reverse sorts by year.

To include a reference, I currently use the `pandoc-ext/multibib` extension. When Quarto updates to use Typst 0.13.0 in version 1.7, this will no longer be necessary.

The current format thus looks like:

1. Add the following to the YAML:

```
bibliography:
  books: "books.bib"
  bookchapters: "book_chapters.bib"
  articles: "journal_articles.bib"
```

2. Include a ref div where you want to insert the references:

```
:::{#refs-KEY}
:::
```

where key is one of the keys in your YAML (e.g., `book`, `bookchapters`, or `articles`).

This is totally open and you could include things like "Working Papers" with their own bib file.

The key limitation (currently) is that you require a different `.bib` file for each of your types of citation listings.

## Other tips: General Quarto syntax work

### Tables

Here, we can see that you can use text or a tables if included functions are insufficient. For full documentation on Quarto, see: <https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>.

### Raw Typst

Typst is much easier to learn than LaTeX in my opinion. If you want to add some custom features, you can do that with raw Typst chunks.

For example, suppose that this is a fake CV for a famed, but deceased, member of the Harvard faculty.
You might want to add a quote from the NYT obit:

```{=typst}
#quote(attribution: "Sam Roberts, NYTimes", block: true)[
  Sidney Verba, whose pioneering research comparing political behavior among the worldâ€™s democracies became a classic book among students of politics, died on March 4 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 86.
]
```
